                        <p>I've been rock climbing for about five years now. I started climbing in a local gym, 
                            then moved to outdoor climbing about three years ago. I mostly climb in the Alberta 
                            rockies; however, I have also climbed at a few locations in Tahoe and Yosemite! 
                            Climbing for me has been a great oppurtunity to explore the outdoors and see places I never would be able to just hiking. </p>

                        <h3>Snowboarding</h3>
                        <p>Snowboarding has been part of my life since I was a young kid. I was lucky 
                            to grow up in a cold snowy city with three small ski resorts within the city limits. 
                            I first started to learn during school field trips to the local hills, from there, it clicked. 
                            The -20 degree weather, five hour long drives, and sleepless nights are always worth 
                            a good day of snowboarding.</p>

                        <h4>Hiking</h4>
                        <p>I didn't grow up being outdoorsy. I went on my first hike while in university, 
                            wearing jeans, converse, and I brought a single 500-ml water bottle. Since then, 
                            I've learned a couple things and have grown an appreciation for the outdoors. 
                            By far, my favorite adventures have included a three day backpack on the Alta Via 1 in Italy.
                            However, the trail I believe everyone should expereince once would be the Lake O'Hara Alpine circuit in British Columbia. 
                            Lake O'Hara has some of the best trails I have ever seen. But because of the high demand it needs 
                            to be planned months in advance due to limited bus space!  </p>

                        <h5>Baking</h5>
                        <p>I started to get very good at cake decorating when I worked at a cake shop for about three years in high-school. Since then, 
                            I have always enjoyed it because I loved sharing the things I made with my friends and family.
                             Baking things from scratch also means its healthy because I didnt buy it
                              from a store (haha). Mostly I love baking cheesecake and cheescake cupcakes. 
                              But recently I have been getting into baking breads! </p>
