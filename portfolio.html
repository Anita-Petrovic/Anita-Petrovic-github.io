                        <h2>Hydrogen Motorcycle</h2>
                        <p> The project aimed to establish the feasibility of powering a motorcycle with a hydrogen fuel cell. The goals were to source and calculate the total cost of components for the powertrain design and to perform high-level component integration and simulation. My contributions included creating CAD components, designing the fuel cell schematics, and conducting Simulink simulations to assess the performance of the fuel cell, supercapacitor, DC/DC converter, and motor system under various loading conditions.</p>

                        <h3>Arduino Memory Game</h3>
                        <p> The Arduino Joystick Memory Game is an interactive project of mine where players replicate sequences of blinking lights using a joystick. The game setup includes four LEDs arranged in a diamond pattern on a breadboard, with sequences of blinks generated randomly. As players successfully mimic these patterns, the sequences become increasingly complex, adding extra blinks with each level.

                        <h4>EcoCar UrbanConcept Suspension Hub</h4>
                        <p> EcoCar is a student vehicle project at the University of Alberta, 
                            which I was part of for five years. For this project, 
                            I designed a new hub for our UrbanConcept vehicle, which achieved 
                            almost a 50% reduction in weight while maintaining structural, 
                            maintenance, and safety requirements. The design process included 
                            multiple iterations and simulations to analyze the part and create 
                            an optimized final product.</p>

                        <h5>Suspension Bushing Test Fixture</h5>
                        <p> At Lucid Motors, one project of mine involved the design of a bushing test fixture. The final design of the fixture was deemed free of proprietary material and can be seen on the right. <p></p>

                            The fixture was composed of multiple steel CNC'd components, which would clamp bushings down and attach them to a CTW LA-48 actuator. The design process was iterative and involved many revisions. FEA was used to enhance the design by reducing material, limiting deflection, and ensuring the parts can handle maximum loading conditions.<p></p>
                            
                            The actuator was programmed using chrip signals to dynamically and statically test the bushings. I then created a MATLAB program to analyze data from various suppliers to ensure they met performance benchmarks.</p>

                        <p> Another EcoCar project of mine involved the design of an aerodynamic side-view mirror. The design included tailored draft angles that could be integrated into the outer shell's mold during the carbon fiber layup process. This integration technique enabled the mirror to become a seamless part of the vehicle's carbon shell, enhancing both aesthetics and aerodynamics.</p>
